**Game Server Examples**

In this repository you will find examples of game servers for different types of games using different libraries.

I am primarily doing this to track my progression on this subject and to build my skills up enough for a larger scale project further down the line.

The clients will be included in each directory, but for the most part will be fairly barebones.

**Example List**

1. CLI Tic-Tac-Toe - C Sockets
2. TBD
